# Advent of Code 2024 - Deno Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository, where programming meets
holiday cheer! ðŸŽ„ Dive into this collection of fun, challenging puzzles designed
to test your problem-solving skills and spread the joy of coding. Each day's
challenge is solved in **Deno**, with a clear and consistent structure to make
navigation and replication a breeze.

## **What is Advent of Code?**

Think of it as an Advent calendar, but instead of chocolates, you get daily
programming puzzles! Created by [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/about),
Advent of Code is a beloved tradition among developers of all skill levels.
Whether you're prepping for interviews, practicing algorithms, or simply
competing with friends, there's something here for everyone.

### **Why Participate?**

- Sharpen your coding skills ðŸš€
- Learn something new every day ðŸ“š
- Join a vibrant, global community ðŸŒŽ

No computer science degree? No problem! These puzzles require only basic
programming knowledge and a knack for logical thinking. Plus, every challenge is
optimized to run on hardware as old as Santa's sled (okay, maybe 10 years old
ðŸ˜‰).

## **Folder Structure**

Hereâ€™s how the magic is organized:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.json
â”œâ”€â”€ day_01
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ day_02
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ day_03
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ day_04
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample_02.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ deno.json
â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ markdown.md
â””â”€â”€ utils.ts
```

### **Key Components**

1. **`.vscode/`:** Houses editor-specific settings to streamline development.
2. **`day_<number>/`:** Each folder contains:
   - `main.ts`: The solution script for that day.
   - `input.txt`: The actual puzzle input.
   - `sample.txt` (and `sample_02.txt` if provided): Sample inputs for debugging
     and testing.
3. **Root-Level Files:**
   - `deno.json`: Deno configuration file for smooth execution.
   - `main.ts`: Entry script to run specific day solutions.
   - `markdown.md`: Documentation and notes.
   - `utils.ts`: Shared utility functions used across days.

## **How to Run the Solutions**

Unwrapping a puzzle solution is as simple as running this command:

```bash
# Replace [day number] with the day you want to run
deno run start [day number]
```

### **Example**

To solve Day 1â€™s challenge:

```bash
deno run start 1
```

### **Requirements**

- Install [Deno](https://deno.land) if you havenâ€™t already.
- Ensure `deno.json` is in the root directory for configurations.
